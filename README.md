Description:
Hunt the Wumpus is a classic video game, based on a simple hide and seek 
format. It this game, you feature as a player character who is traped in 
a cave, together with a monster, the Wumpus. The cave consist of a 
network of rooms. 

Some of the rooms contain obstacles, for more information about the 
obstacles see the subject 'Objects', wich can either help you or be 
fatal to you.

The purpose of the game is to kill the Wumpus and escape in this way. 
But watch out. It might be possible that you will get killed..
_________________________________________________________________________


Objects:
There are different obstacles you may encounter.
Bottomless pits: 
	If you fall into a bottomless pit, you will fall forever and
	ever, and thus lose the game

Super bats: 
	If you encounter the super bats, they will pick you up and land 
	you in a random room in the cavern. This can either be helpfull, 
	because you can avoid the Wumpus if it is near you, or it can be
	fatal to you, if it places you very close to the Wumpus.

Gold: 
	You can collect the different peaces of gold in the cavern, to 
	get your score higher.

Wumpus: 
	The Wumpus is the monster that lives in the cavern. The only way 
	to kill it, is by using your arrows, the Wumpus is immume for 
	everything else. How to use your arrows will be explained later 
	on, at the subject 'Controlls'. As you walk, the Wumpus is 
	moving towards you, so make sure you are carefull.

Arrows:
	These are the only objects you can use to kill the Wumpus. At the
	start of each game there are four arrows available for you and 
	every arrow can change its direction up to five times.


If you are near an object, you will see a message in the sidebar. There 
are different kind of messages:
'You hear the flapping of wings' 
	This will mean that there are bats in one of the rooms you are 
	able to enter.

'You feel the draft from the pit'
	This means that you are near a room with a bottomless pit, so 
	make sure you pick teh right room if you don't want to die.

'You can detect a glimmer'
	If you get this message, it means that you are near a room with 
	gold.

'You can smell the foul stench of the Wumpus'
	This message means that you should watch out, because the Wumpus
	is near you.

'You faintly smell something unpleasant'
	When you see this, you should be carefull, because the Wumpus 
	is getting closer to you, but it isn't in a room next to you.

prepare your arrow. The arrow can change his direction up to five times 
and to really shoot the arrow after you choose the route it should take, 
you only have to press the enter key. If you made a mstake and you don't 
want to shoot your arrow as you first told it to, you simply press the 
spacebar again to cancel the action.
